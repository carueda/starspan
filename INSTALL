STARSPAN Installation instructions
$Id$

Software prerequisites
The following dependencies must be properly installed on your system:

    * GEOS 2.1.1 or newer
    * GDAL 1.2.6 or newer

These dependencies can be installed as follows.
Notes:

    * You will need to manually download and install the
    versions indicated above; in particular, the versions
    through the Debian packaging mechanism are often older
    than the required ones.

    * No --prefix option is used in the corresponding
    ./configure commands that we show below. Adjust this as
    necessary if you need/want to install these libraries
    under non-standard locations.

    * See also a note on Large File Support that may be
    important for your system if you are going to process
    large raster files.

GEOS - Geometry Engine - Open Source, version 2.1.1

This library is required to support geometry operations (via
OGR/GDAL and directly by STARSPAN to fix self-intersecting
polygons). Note for Windows/Cygwin users: The GEOS 2.1.1
will not compile under cygwin. Either download a newer GEOS
release or the available CVS snapshot.

    * Go to http://geos.refractions.net/  and download geos-2.1.1.tar.bz2 (or newer)
    * bunzip2 geos-2.1.1.tar.bz2
    * tar xf geos-2.1.1.tar
    * cd geos-2.1.1
    * ./configure
    * make
    * make install   # perhaps as root depending on install directory

GDAL - Geospatial Data Abstraction Library

    * Go to http://www.gdal.org/dl/ and download gdal-1.2.6.tar.gz or newer.
    * tar zxf gdal-1.2.6.tar.gz
    * cd gdal-1.2.6
    * ./configure  --with-geos=/usr/local/bin/geos-config
    * make
    * make install    # perhaps as root depending on install directory

starspan code
The starspan tool can be installed as follows.

    * Go to http://casil.ucdavis.edu/project/showfiles.php?group_id=48
    and download starspan-XXXX.tar.gz where XXXX is the most
    recent release number.

    * tar zxf starspan-XXXX.tar.gz
    * cd starspan-XXXX
    * cp Makefile.props.templ Makefile.props
      # NOTE for MacOS X: you may want to use Makefile.props.fink instead.
    
    * # Edit Makefile.props for necessary adjustments
    according to your local system (e.g. to put the right
    values if required libraries are installed in
    non-standard locations, and to specify where starspan
    will be installed). Also see below for extended usage
    dependencies.
    
    * make
    * make test       # only if you are on a little-endian byte order
                      #machine (e.g. Intel based)
    * make install    # perhaps as root depending on install directory

That's it

The executables starspan and starspan2 are now installed in
your system under the location specified in the parameter
STARSPAN_PREFIX in Makefile.props. Note that the main entry
point for end users is the shell script starspan.

Extended usage dependencies

Note: If you don't plan to run the extended functionalities,
just ignore the rest of this section.

Certain testing options require a JRE (Java Runtime
Environment) and a number of Java archives as explained
below.

The required Java archives must be copied manually in
$(STARSPAN_PREFIX)/bin/starspan.jars/

The extended usage options are:

--view_geometries option:
This option requires:
     plotapplication.jar
Which can be downloaded from http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/java/ptplot
This option has been tested with version 5.1p2.

--test
--jts options:
These options require:
xerces.jar
jts-1.4.0.jar
jdom.jar
JTS_Test.jar
Acme.jar
Which can be downloaded from http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/jtshome.htm
This option has been tested with JTS 1.4
