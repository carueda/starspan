STARSPAN Installation instructions
$Id$

Software prerequisites
The following dependencies must be properly installed on your system:

    * GEOS 2.1.1 or newer
    * GDAL 1.2.5 or newer

These dependencies can be installed as follows.
Notes:

    * You will need to manually download and install the versions indicated
    above; in particular, the versions through the Debian packaging mechanism
    are older than the required ones.
	
    * No --prefix option is used in the corresponding ./configure commands. See
    below for details.
	
    * See also a note on LFS - Large File Support that may be important for your
    system if you are going to process large raster files.

GEOS - Geometry Engine - Open Source, version 2.1.1
This library is required to support geometry operations via OGR/GDAL.

    * Go to http://geos.refractions.net/  and download geos-2.1.1.tar.bz2 (or newer)
    * bunzip2 geos-2.1.1.tar.bz2
    * tar xf geos-2.1.1.tar
    * cd geos-2.1.1
    * ./configure
    * make
    * sudo make install

GDAL - Geospatial Data Abstraction Library

    * Go to http://gdal.org/dl/ and download gdal-1.2.5.tar.gz or newer.
    * tar zxf gdal-1.2.5.tar.gz
    * cd gdal-1.2.5
    * ./configure  --with-geos=/usr/local/bin/geos-config
    * make
    * sudo make install

starspan code
The starspan tool can be installed as follows.

    * Go to http://casil.ucdavis.edu/project/showfiles.php?group_id=48 and
    download starspan-XXXX.tar.gz where XXXX is the most recent release number.
	
    * tar zxf starspan-XXXX.tar.gz
    * cd starspan-XXXX
    * cp Makefile.props.templ Makefile.props

    * # Edit Makefile.props for necessary adjustments according to your local
    system (e.g. to put the right values if required libraries are installed in
    non-standard locations, and to specify where starspan will be installed).
    Also see below for extended usage dependencies.

    * make
    * make install    # perhaps as root depending on install directory

That's it

The executables starspan and starspan2 are now installed in your system. Note
that the entry point for end users is the shell script starspan.

Extended usage dependencies

Certain testing options require a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) and a number of
Java archives as explained below.

Note: If you don't plan to run these extended functionalities, just ignore the
rest of this section.

The required Java archives must be copied manually in
$(STARSPAN_PREFIX)/bin/starspan.jars/

The extended usage options are:

--view_geometries option:
This option requires:
     plotapplication.jar
Which can be downloaded from http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/java/ptplot
This option has been tested with version 5.1p2.

--test
--jts options:
	These options require:
		xerces.jar
		jts-1.4.0.jar
		jdom.jar
		JTS_Test.jar
		Acme.jar
Which can be downloaded from http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/jtshome.htm
This option has been tested with JTS 1.4.
