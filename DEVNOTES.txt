2004-09-28 (0.8beta)
	StatsObserver: vector<Pixel> pixels (was vector<Pixel*>).
	
	getBandValues renamed to getBandValuesForPixel in both Raster and Traveser
	classes.
	
2004-09-27 (0.8beta)
	-update_{csv,dbf} options: fixed bug: col,row were not made 0-based for
	proper extraction.
	
2004-09-26 (0.7beta)
	pixel duplicates revisited:
	
		LineRasterizer#line now includes flag 'last' to indicate if ending
		pixel should be reported.
		
		LineRasterizer: more tests to verify intersections by using
		JTS test builder and Envi ...
	
2004-09-25
	stats: fixed extraction bug: (col,row) were 1-based via TraversalEvent's, 
	but then used as 0-based.
	As a general revision, all (col,row) locations are now 0-based in traverser
	module, and clients have been adjusted to report them as 1-based.
	
	building with GDAL 1.2.3 .. ok
	
2004-09-24
	traverser: 
		new Observer#end() to notify observer when process
		has finished.
	
		now list of observers: addObserver instead of setObserver
		
	StatsObserver: new observer to compute basic statistics.
	command-line scheme:
		-stats [avg | stdev | min | max ]... file.csv
		
2004-09-16
	starspan2.cc: collect args before creating main objects.
	(arg processing might be based on getopt or similar in a future version.)
	
	New module csv to read CSV files--adapted from TPOP source code
	http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/tpop/code.html
	
	New operation starspan_update_csv
	New operation starspan_update_dbf
	
	(I started to use GDAL 1.2.2 which was just realeased today.)
	
	-envisl:  name for spectra: FID:col:row:x:y
	
	New options:
		-noColRow: do not include col,row fields in -csv, -dbf
		-noXY:     do not include x,y fields in -csv, -dbf
	
2004-09-13
	General refactoring to allow the processing of multiple input rasters.
	Traverser has now methods to specify data input objects; all object
	interfaces updated.
	
	All output formats updated for multi raster processing:
		-envi, -envisl: A check is done to verify that all bands are
		                the same type.
		
		-jtstest: checks only one raster is specified.
		
		-mr: checks only one raster is specified; should be fixed for
		multiple rasters but this is NOT going to be done for now.
		    
	
	starspan_gen_envisl: 
		Data file is basename.img for Envi image, and basename.sld for
		spectral library.
		In header for .img: samples = 1; lines = #pixels; bands = #bands
		In header for .sld: samples = #bands; lines = #pixels; bands = 1
		Note: data file is written out in exactly the same way (bip interleave).
	
2004-09-11
	Problems with large file support; this is happening on ceres but
	works fine on scorpio and px (my laptop). 
	I'm also having a strange behavior with gdal not being able to 
	recognize an envi image on scorpio, though it just reads fine on
	ceres and px (?).
	
2004-09-10
	Band# names now starting from 1.
	
	-envi:  creates envi image
	-envisl:  creates envi spectral library
	
	Option -fields fieldname1,fieldname2,... to select fields from vector file.
	In the case of envi output (-envi, -envisl), the following files will
	be generated:
	will generate:
		<basename>_<fieldname1>.ser
		<basename>_<fieldname2>.ser
		...
		
	starspan_gen_envisl.cc #includes <list.h> although it should be <list>.
	For some reason <list> does not compile on scorpio, gcc 3.3.4!
	(<list> compiles just fine with my gcc 2.95.4).
	
	
2004-09-09
	TraversalEvent: (col,row) is now (1,1)-based (to be more
	compatible with standard tools, e.g. envi).
	
	starspan_jtstest: new parameter use_polys to represent pixels as
	polygons (rectangles) for visualization in the JTS test builder.
	
	Some cleaning up and minor refactoring before working on multiple
	raster inputs.
	
2004-09-08
	New option -csv to generate a CSV output file.
	Option -db renamed to -dbf
	
	Traverser: new approach for pixel inclusion in intersections
	resulting in polygons. A parameter pixelProprtion is used.
	New option -pixprop.
	Basic scheme implemented but should be adjusted for better 
	efficiency.
	New option -fid.
	
	JTS_TestGenerator: now a case can be cancelled, useful when empty
	arguments are found.
	
2004-09-07
	Complete build process revised and reported in
	http://starspan.casil.ucdavis.edu/?Build
	Makefile: GDAL_SRC_DIR to specify where GDAL sources are
	installed. Other locations also specified via definitions.
	NOTE: A more general scheme (maybe via configure) is
	still required for a smooth build.
	
	New objects for traversal: TraversalEvent, PixelLocation
	
	starspan_db: now puts: FID, col,row, {vect-attrs}, {rast-bands}
	See doc in starspan.h
	
2004-09-06
	A second pass over the traverser module.
	It now uses a LineRasterizer to process linestrings.
	starspan_jtstest now implemented as a traverser client.
	
2004-09-05
	rasterizers/ New module for rasterizations.
	Now with a LineRasterizer, whose implementation is based on a
	Bresenham interpolator with sub-pixel accuracy thanks to the
	Anti-Grain Geometry engine, http://www.antigrain.com/.
	Note that all that is needed for this dependency is to
	#include agg_dda_line.h (no AGG library is required).
	
2004-08-31
	-db now includes the fields, in the given order:
		- (x,y)  location of signature
		- attributes from source geometry feature
		- band values
		
2004-08-30
	Option -db to create a DBF with pixels contained in vector features.
	Added some design documentation.
	
2004-08-22
	New option -envisl to create en envi spectral library.
	This function uses a traverser object.
	Still lacking enough testing.
	GDAL limitation: no access to wavelength metadata. 
	It seems some ENVI functionality will have to be written anyway.
	
2004-08-21
	New traverser module to provide a skeleton for basic processing.
	The observer pattern is used so interested objects can perform
	a number of tasks.

2004-08-20
	Option -in to work with -mr
	
2004-08-10
	(unsuccessful) workarounds for proper projection in mini rasters
	(beacuse of GDAL limitations).

2004-08-08
	organization
	mini raster generation, option -mr

2004-08-04
	New jts module.
	New option -jtstest that generates a JTS test suite.
	starspan has started passing the first tests :-)

2004-08-03
	In order to have GEOS functionality from within GDAL I did
	the following:
	
		Installed GEOS:
			- ``cvs co geos''
			- ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install
			  I fixed some minor errors about comparisons, but
			  I hacked the Makefile to replace INTERFACE_* for
			  arbitrary numbers. ;-(  I couldn't find any help about
			  this error.  Finally it compiled
			  
		Installed GDAL:
			- ``cvs checkout gdal''  to have the most recent GDAL source
			  (since GEOS is not yet officially released).
			- ./configure --with-geos=/usr/local/bin/geos-config
			- ``make'' (I fixed some minor errors in ogrgeometry.cpp)
			- ``make install''
			
	starspan2.cc: initial version with geom->Contains(point) and a very
	simple report of points contained in the geometries of the vector datasource.
			
	

2004-08-02
	Working now on the C++ code.
	New interface modules:
		vector/Vector.h   with shapelib and OGR implementations
		raster/Raster.h   with GDAL implementation

2004-08-01
	Geotools: I was not able to find a good Java library to work on
	rasters in different formats (not even for Envi files). Although I have
	written some code for Envi in BIP format (SAMS), I would spend a lot
	of time writing the map management and the BSQ and BIL interleaves.
	I'll continue with the C++ approach.
	
2004-07-29
	First geotools tests OK ;-)
	See java/README.txt
	
2004-07-28
	GeoTools seems an interesting way to go:
	  - http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOTOOLS/Data+access+basic+tutorial
	    Data access basic tutorial -- shapefile example
	Also JTS Topology Suite - http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/JTSHome.htm
	(in fact geotools uses JTS)
	I'll try geotools ..
	 

	
---- C/C++ code -----

SHPLIB
	Some tests to link against the shplib library:
		make
		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
		./shpdump  # OK
		
CGAL
	I installed CGAL-3.0.1 to support the implementation of
	Polygon.h
