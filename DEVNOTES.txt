	Working now on the C++ code.
	New interface modules:
		vector/Vector.h   with shapelib and OGR implementations
		raster/Raster.h   with GDAL implementation
	Using tool2.cc for the prototype

	Geotools: I was not able to find a good Java library to work on
	rasters in different formats (not even for Envi files). Although I have
	written some code for Envi in BIP format (SAMS), I would spend a lot
	of time writing the map management and the BSQ and BIL interleaves.
	I'll continue with the C++ approach.

	First geotools tests OK ;-)
	See java/README.txt

	GeoTools seems an interesting way to go:
	  - http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOTOOLS/Data+access+basic+tutorial
	    Data access basic tutorial -- shapefile example
	Also JTS Topology Suite - http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/JTSHome.htm
	(in fact geotools uses JTS)
	I'll try geotools ..
	 

	
---- C/C++ code -----

SHPLIB
	Some tests to link against the shplib library:
		make
		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
		./shpdump  # OK
		
CGAL
	I installed CGAL-3.0.1 to support the implementation of
	Polygon.h
