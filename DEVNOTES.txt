	Complete build process revised and reported in
	http://starspan.casil.ucdavis.edu/?Build
	Makefile: GDAL_SRC_DIR to specify where GDAL sources are
	installed. Other locations also specified via definitions.
	NOTE: A more general scheme (maybe via configure) is
	still required for a smooth build.
	
2004-09-06
	A second, more definitive definitive of the traverser module.
	It now uses a LineRasterizer to process linestrings.
	starspan_jtstest now implemented on a traverser.
	
2004-09-05
	rasterizers/ New module for rasterizations.
	Now with a LineRasterizer, whose implementation is based on a
	Bresenham interpolator with sub-pixel accuracy thanks to the
	Anti-Grain Geometry engine, http://www.antigrain.com/.
	Note that all that is needed for this dependency is to
	#include agg_dda_line.h (no AGG library is required).
	
2004-08-31
	-db now includes the fields, in the given order:
		- (x,y)  location of signature
		- attributes from source geometry feature
		- band values
		
2004-08-30
	Option -db to create a DBF with pixels contained in vector features.
	Added some design documentation.
	
2004-08-22
	New option -envisl to create en envi spectral library.
	This function uses a traverser object.
	Still lacking enough testing.
	GDAL limitation: no access to wavelength metadata. 
	It seems some ENVI functionality will have to be written anyway.
	
2004-08-21
	New traverser module to provide a skeleton for basic processing.
	The observer pattern is used so interested objects can perform
	a number of tasks.

2004-08-20
	Option -in to work with -mr
	
2004-08-10
	(unsuccessful) workarounds for proper projection in mini rasters
	(beacuse of GDAL limitations).

2004-08-08
	organization
	mini raster generation, option -mr

2004-08-04
	New jts module.
	New option -jtstest that generates a JTS test suite.
	starspan has started passing the first tests :-)

2004-08-03
	In order to have GEOS functionality from within GDAL I did
	the following:
	
		Installed GEOS:
			- ``cvs co geos''
			- ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install
			  I fixed some minor errors about comparisons, but
			  I hacked the Makefile to replace INTERFACE_* for
			  arbitrary numbers. ;-(  I couldn't find any help about
			  this error.  Finally it compiled
			  
		Installed GDAL:
			- ``cvs checkout gdal''  to have the most recent GDAL source
			  (since GEOS is not yet officially released).
			- ./configure --with-geos=/usr/local/bin/geos-config
			- ``make'' (I fixed some minor errors in ogrgeometry.cpp)
			- ``make install''
			
	starspan2.cc: initial version with geom->Contains(point) and a very
	simple report of points contained in the geometries of the vector datasource.
			
	

2004-08-02
	Working now on the C++ code.
	New interface modules:
		vector/Vector.h   with shapelib and OGR implementations
		raster/Raster.h   with GDAL implementation

2004-08-01
	Geotools: I was not able to find a good Java library to work on
	rasters in different formats (not even for Envi files). Although I have
	written some code for Envi in BIP format (SAMS), I would spend a lot
	of time writing the map management and the BSQ and BIL interleaves.
	I'll continue with the C++ approach.
	
2004-07-29
	First geotools tests OK ;-)
	See java/README.txt
	
2004-07-28
	GeoTools seems an interesting way to go:
	  - http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOTOOLS/Data+access+basic+tutorial
	    Data access basic tutorial -- shapefile example
	Also JTS Topology Suite - http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/JTSHome.htm
	(in fact geotools uses JTS)
	I'll try geotools ..
	 

	
---- C/C++ code -----

SHPLIB
	Some tests to link against the shplib library:
		make
		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
		./shpdump  # OK
		
CGAL
	I installed CGAL-3.0.1 to support the implementation of
	Polygon.h
