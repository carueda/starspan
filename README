STARSPAN Readme

About starspan 
-------------- 
starspan is designed to bridge the raster and vector worlds of spatial
analysis using fast algorithms for pixel level extraction from point
and polygon data. The main purpose of starspan is to generate
databases of pixel values (from one or a set of raster images) falling
within points or polygons, and fusing them with the database
attributes from the vector files. This allows a user to do statistical
analysis of the pixel vs attribute data in any existing statistical
package (the output of starspan is a CSV file) and can greatly speed
up classification training and testing using many image analysis
packages (e.g. ENVI, Imagine, PCI) by focusing the classification on
only pixels with known attributes, not the entire image.


Installing starspan
-------------------
starspan requires the GDAL and GEOS libraries properly installed on 
your system. For more details, see INSTALL.
