In this directory we create a binary distribution of StarSpan for Windows.

Prerequisites
	The GuiE library: guie.jar
	http://guie.sf.net
	
	IzPack is used to create the installer.
	http://izforge.com/izpack
	
	Apache Ant is used to build the system.
	http://ant.apache.org
	
	End users will need a Java Runtime Environment to be able to run
	the StarSpan GUI.

Build
	You may need to adjust some values in build.properties according
	to location of prerequisites in your system.
	
	To create the installer: 
		ant installer
	The executable takes the name install-starspan-win32-${VERSION}.jar
	
	To test the installation:
		ant install
		
Running:
	After installation on a Windows machine, either use the file browser
	to run DIR\bin\starspan-gui.bat, where DIR is the installation 
	directory, or launch the shortcut created by the installer.
	
Status:
	Experimental
