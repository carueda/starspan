\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

	\starspan{} is an open source computer program developed at Center of Spatial
	Technologies and Remote Sensing (CSTARS) for fast and flexible extraction of
	pixel data from spectral raster images. The tool was developed as part
	of a project for mapping invasive plant species using hyperspectral
	imagery ... \citep{ustin04}.
	
	Main inputs for the program are one or multiple raster files and a vector
	file defining a set of geometry features. The basic operation performed by
	\starspan{} is the extraction of the spectral data from the raster files
	whose pixels are geometrically contained in the geometry features (points,
	lines, polygons) in the vector data. Extracted pixel data are stored in a
	number of different formats, including ENVI \citep{envi} (standard image and
	spectral library) and CSV (comma-separated values), a common text-based
	format that can be imported into standard applications for further analysis.
	Other functionalities include the generation of band specific statistics for
	specified features, extraction of features into individual raster
	(mini-raster generation), update options, and generation of paired pixel
	band values for subsequent calculation of calibration coefficients.
	
	As a design goal, \starspan is written under object-oriented principles
	so it can be easily extended with new functionalities without significant
	loss in performance.

\subsection{Inputs and general options}

Raster data is given through the \verb|-raster| option:

	\verb|-raster| $R_1\ R_2\ \cdots\ R_n$

where $R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_n$ are raster datasets recognized by the GDAL library.

Vector data is given with the \verb|-vector| option:
	
	\verb|-vector| $V$

where $V$ is a vector datasource recognized by the OGR library.

There are some general options ...

	\verb|-fields| field$_1$ field$_2\ \cdots$ field$_n$
	
Only the specified fields will be transferred from vector file $V$
to the output. Use spaces to separate the field names.  Example:

   \verb|starspan -vector V -raster R -csv my.csv  -fields species foo|

will extract the fields with names `species' and `foo.' If no field from the
vector metadata is desired, just give the keyword \verb|-fields| with no
arguments. By default, all fields from vector will be extracted.

	\verb|-pixprop| value

Minimum proportion of pixel area in intersection so that the pixel is included.
A value in [0.0, 1.0] must be given.
Only used in intersections resulting in polygons. 
By default, the pixel proportion is 0.5. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Statistics}

Command \verb|-stats| is used to generate basic band-wise statistics for each
intersecting feature. Example:

	\verb|starspan -vector V -raster R -stats mystats.csv avg mode|

Creates \verb|mystats.csv|, a CSV (comma-separated-values) file containing
computed statistics for each FID. In the above example, codes \verb|avg| and
\verb|mode|
indicate to compute the average and mode statistics. Available statistics 
are shown in Table \ref{table-stats}.
\begin{table}[!ht]
\centering
\caption{Statistics}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline 
  code        & computes for each feature\\
\hline
\verb|avg  |  &   average of pixels in feature\\
\verb|mode |  &   Most frequent value\\
\verb|stdev|  &   sample standard deviation of pixels in feature\\
\verb|min  |  &   minimum value of pixels in feature\\
\verb|max  |  &   maximum value of pixels in feature\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table-stats}
\end{table}

Output:

    * mystats.csv : containing computed statistics.

First line in resulting \verb|myfile.csv| contain column headers:

    * FID: Feature ID
    * Names of attributes from the given input vector $V$ associated to FID. 
	If option \verb|-fields| is given, only the given fields will be extracted.
    * Band names. Each name takes the form $s$\_Band\#, where $s$
	is the code of the statistics, eg. \verb|stdev|, and \# is the band number 
	according to given rasters.

Subsequent lines contain corresponding values for each FID.

\section{Software requirements}

	In order to build \starspan{} the following libraries are required.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item GEOS, Geometry Engine \citep{geos}.
				This library is required to support geometry operations.
				
		\item GDAL - Geospatial Data Abstraction Library \citep{gdal}.
	\end{itemize}


\section{Conclusion and further work}

	Currently \starspan{} has been tested and used on Linux based operating
	environments. On the works is to make the tool publicly available and easy
	to install on different operating systems.
