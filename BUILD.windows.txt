BUILD on windows

	Attempting to build on windows/cygwin again:
	
		GEOS 2.1.1: I only needed to specify 
		extern "C" { #include <ieeefp.h> }
		in geos/platform.h and compilation goes fine.
		
		GDAL 1.2.6: ... problems at linking stage: it cannot
		find some geos::WKT... stuff  :-(
		Then I tried with mingw as indicated in gdal.org.faq.html
		and it compiled fine.
		
		starspan 0.962beta: Compiles but fails with many unresolved 
		link symbols. I guess it's because of the mixing of library
		modes... I'd need to check this again later when I have more
		time.
